# Rick-and-Morty
My first web page with React

This project is about a single-page application created with React and ant desing where you can find a table that shows you some characters of the series Rick and Morty.

Before you try to start up the app, you need to have installed Node.js, with a version equal to or greater than 10.16, and npm, with a version equal to or greater than 5.6. Also, you need to install npm packages in the carpet of the project.

Finally, to run the app, you have to do that in a terminal and write npm start, because the project uses a local server to run.
